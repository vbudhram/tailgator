Project Abstract: The primary goal of this project was to create an efficient, portable and renewable power source. To achieve the highest efficiency, the device would utilize a solar panel that would position itself in such a manner that it would optimize the amount of light it received. The device would also be portable enough that a regular person would be able to easily carry it in a bag or with two hands.

Details:

The project contains the source code for the control box. It interfaces an ATmega32 processor to a LCD, stepper motors, A/D converters and photosensors.
